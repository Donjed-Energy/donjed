Calculate your daily energy consumption:\n   - List all appliances and their wattage\n   - Multiply by hours of daily use\n   - Add 20% buffer for inefficiencies\n\n2. Common household loads:\n   - Air conditioner (1.5HP): 1,500W x 8 hours = 12kWh\n   - Refrigerator: 150W x 24 hours = 3.6kWh\n   - Lighting (10 bulbs): 200W x 6 hours = 1.2kWh\n   - TV and electronics: 300W x 6 hours = 1.8kWh\n   - Total example: ~19kWh per day\n\n3. Recommended system size:\n   - For 15-20kWh daily: 5kW system\n   - For 25-35kWh daily: 7.5kW system\n   - For 40-50kWh daily: 10kW system",
